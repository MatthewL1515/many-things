## Planning

* I want to create a game-like code that contains randomly moving circles and a singular mouse-controlled circle that moves freely. As time goes on, the randomly moving circles begin moving faster, and if the mouse-controlled circle collides with the generated circles, the game will pause, with all objects freezing on the screen. When a key is pressed, the game will restart.
